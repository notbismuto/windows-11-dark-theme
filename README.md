⚠️ | DON'T USE THIS SHIT

I'm just now realizing that it works incorrectly and bugs very badly with graphical bugs like the texts in classic menus
are not noticeable or that when hovering over a classic button it turns completely black and I'm too lazy to fix that
so don't download it :)


download reg file and execute it

when you double-click you will see this window

click yes and you will see this
